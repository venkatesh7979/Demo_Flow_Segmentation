    <strong>Harmonic Flows</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Until now we were mostly dealing with the complex flows which only have
    local phenomena i.e. elementary flows will have diminishing effect as we
    move away from their center. Now we can work on the flows which have global
    phenomena where effects due to the elementary flows can be seen everywhere
    in the complex flow field.

    Harmonic flows comprise the elementary flows that can be formulated with
    the sinusoidal velocity functions with various frequencies. Each sinusoidal
    function has a different amplitude and its only space-variant. These flows
    can be considered to be inviscid and in-compressible. A complex flow based
    on the Harmonic flows can be formed by superimposing various velocity
    fields that are made of sinusoidal functions. The discussion on harmonic
    flows with examples in figure 1 is as follows:
